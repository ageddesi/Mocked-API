# An example hook script to verify what is about to be committed.
# Called by "git commit" with no arguments.  The hook should
# exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message if
# it wants to stop the commit.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "pre-commit" and add it under `.git/hooks/`.

# Fixes and throws error if cannot
npm run lint-fix
