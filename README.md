## About

Welcome to Mocked-API, this is a live API that can be accessed by anyone who needs data to test out their website, app, components etc.

## Getting Started

First you should head over to https://api.mocked-api.dev and read our live api docs than start calling the api endpoints for the data you need.

## How to run Mocked-API
Once you've cloned this repository, running Mocked-API is quite easy, there are just 2 steps you have to follow:
1. Install the dependencies
```bash

```
2. Serve the application
